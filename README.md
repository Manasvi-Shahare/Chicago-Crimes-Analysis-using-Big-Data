# Chicago-Crimes-Analysis-using-Big-Data
Chicago Crimes Analysis, Visualization and Prediction using Big Data and Machine Learning


Public safety, child development, and adult socioeconomic position are all negatively impacted by crime, a significant social issue in the nation. A police officer may be familiar with dangerous places based on his or her experience, but he or she may not be able to predict the type of crime that would occur. Our goal is to assist police officers by giving pertinent information that is difficult to obtain so they can take the necessary action.


This dataset shows reported crimes that happened in the City of Chicago from 2001 to the present, excluding the most recent seven days, with the exception of murders, for which data is available for each victim. Information is taken from the CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system of the Chicago Police Department. Addresses are only displayed at the block level and exact locations are not specified to preserve the anonymity of crime victims. This information includes reports that were given to the Police Department but were not validated. There is always a chance of human or technological error, and the initial categories of crimes could alter later based on further research. We also looked at historical crime trends, hotspots across time, and places where crimes occurred most frequently.



Regarding the outcomes we will try to visualize and analyze our data based on some different types of analysis like Dataset analysis, Exploratory analysis, Predictive analysis and many more. Our outcomes will provide us the answer for the following questions:
1. Which year saw the greatest hike in Crimes?
2. Which month usually has the highest number of crimes?
3. How does inflation affect the increase in the amount of crimes?
4. Which location has the highest number of crimes?


Evaluation
So we have our evaluation plan ready and it will be followed by us throughout the time period of the project. Our evaluation plan is mentioned as below:
1. Collectingthedata:DatawillbecollectedfromtheofficialwebsiteofChicagocrimeswhich has all the crimes data from 2001 to present.
2. Data Cleaning and pre processing: The data will be properly cleaned and preprocessed such that we do not have any incorrect data and it might not affect our project and give us the proper result.
3. DataVisualization:Thisisthemostimportantpartofourprojectwherethedatacleaned earlier will be visualized and based on that we can predict some outcomes.
4. Data Analysis: This is also an important part where we will perform different types of analysis on our final data and predict some outcomes for the questions that I mentioned earlier
5. PredictingtheaccuracyusingMachineLearningAlgorithms:Thiswillbeveryhelpfulasit helps in predicting future crimes and provides us with some great outcomes.
